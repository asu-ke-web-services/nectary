    <description compact="Commands are used as general task runners, specifically, they differ from sevices and other types of actions in that they should not communicate back to the caller.">In fact, in order to ensure that a command adheres to this expectation,
a utility function called `dispatch` is provided which will handle
a command for you and will not return anything.

The `dispatch` call is also prefered to calling `handle` directly since
Commands can be handled in different ways.</description>
